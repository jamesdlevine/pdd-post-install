# pdd-post-install
## This is the temporary home of the post-install script for pdd-cli.

First install pdd with uv or pip:
#### uv
```
    uv tool install pdd-cli
```
#### pip
```
    pip install pdd-cli
```
Then:
```
   python pdd-setup.py   (from this repo)
```


_pdd-setup.py_ has one external dependency on the _requests_ module, which is installed along with _pdd-cli_

_pdd-setup.py_ will be integrated into the pdd-cli distribution in the near future.
